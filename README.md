# Java Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my Java learning repository! This is where I document my progress as I learn Java programming from scratch.

## 📚 About This Repository

This repository contains Java programs and exercises that I'm working on as part of my journey to learn Java. Each program helps me understand different concepts and features of the Java programming language.

## 🎯 Current Projects

### BuffReader - User Input Program
My first Java program that demonstrates how to read user input using `BufferedReader`.

**What it does:**
- Reads a line of text from the user
- Prints the input back to the console
- Demonstrates basic input/output operations in Java

**Concepts learned:**
- `BufferedReader` for reading input
- `InputStreamReader` for stream conversion
- Exception handling with `throws IOException`
- Basic Java program structure

## 🛠️ How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Java JDK installed (I'm using JDK 25)
- Terminal/Command Prompt access

### Running BuffReader.java

1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac BuffReader.java
   ```

2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java BuffReader
   ```

3. **Provide input:**
   - Type your text (e.g., "Hello, Java!")
   - Press Enter
   - The program will print your input back

### Example:
```
$ java BuffReader
Hello, Java!          ← Your input
Hello, Java!          ← Program output
```

## 📖 Learning Resources

I'm learning Java through various resources and practice. As I progress, I'll add more programs to this repository.

## 🎓 Current Learning Goals

- ✅ Understanding basic Java syntax
- ✅ Reading user input with BufferedReader
- 🔄 Working with different data types
- 🔄 Learning control structures (if, loops)
- ⏳ Object-Oriented Programming concepts

## 📝 Notes

This is a beginner repository - the code may not be perfect, but it represents my learning progress. I'm open to feedback and suggestions!
