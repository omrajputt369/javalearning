## 📚 About This Repository

This repository is my personal learning space where I practice Java programming concepts, build small projects, and document my progress. Each program represents a step forward in understanding Java's core features and best practices.

> 💡 **Goal:** Master Java fundamentals and build a strong foundation for backend development and software engineering.

## 🎯 Projects & Programs

### 1️⃣ BuffReader - User Input Handler
![Completed](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Completed-brightgreen)

My first Java program demonstrating input/output operations using `BufferedReader`.

**✨ Features:**
- Reads user input from console
- Echoes input back to user
- Clean exception handling

**🧠 Concepts Learned:**
- `BufferedReader` for input streams
- `InputStreamReader` for stream conversion
- Exception handling with `throws IOException`
- Java program structure (main method)

**📂 File:** [`BuffReader.java`](BuffReader.java)

### 2️⃣ Scanner - Multiple Input Types
![Completed](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Completed-brightgreen)

A program demonstrating the `Scanner` class for reading different data types from user input.

**✨ Features:**
- Reads String, Integer, and Float inputs
- User-friendly prompts for each input
- Demonstrates type-specific input methods
- Proper resource management with `scanner.close()`

**🧠 Concepts Learned:**
- `Scanner` class for versatile input handling
- Type-specific methods: `nextLine()`, `nextInt()`, `nextFloat()`
- Case sensitivity in Java (String vs string, Scanner vs scanner)
- Proper string concatenation with `+` operator
- Resource management and closing scanners

**📂 File:** [`scanner.java`](scanner.java)

### 3️⃣ BankAccount - Object-Oriented Banking
![Completed](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Completed-brightgreen)

A simple bank account simulation demonstrating object-oriented programming concepts.

**✨ Features:**
- Deposit money into account
- Withdraw money with balance validation
- Check current balance
- Encapsulation with private balance field

**🧠 Concepts Learned:**
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) basics
- Class creation and object instantiation
- Private instance variables (encapsulation)
- Public methods (getters and setters)
- Conditional logic for validation
- Method chaining and object behavior

**📂 File:** [`BankAccount.java`](BankAccount.java)

### 4️⃣ Animal & Dog - Inheritance Demo
![Completed](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Completed-brightgreen)

A program demonstrating Java inheritance with Animal parent class and Dog child class.

**✨ Features:**
- Parent class `Animal` with `eat()` method
- Child class `Dog` extends Animal
- Dog inherits `eat()` from Animal
- Dog adds its own `bark()` method
- Demonstrates method inheritance in action

**🧠 Concepts Learned:**
- **Inheritance** - extending parent classes
- `extends` keyword for creating subclasses
- Method inheritance from parent to child
- Code reusability through inheritance
- Parent-child class relationships
- Multiple classes in one file

**📂 File:** [`Animal.java`](Animal.java)

> **💡 Tip:** This file contains both `Animal` and `Dog` classes. The `main` method is in `Dog`:
> ```bash
> javac Animal.java
> java Dog  # Run the class with main method
> ```

## 🛠️ How to Run

### Prerequisites
```bash
☑️ Java JDK 11+ (I'm using JDK 25)
☑️ Terminal/Command Prompt
☑️ Text editor or IDE (optional)
```

### Running Any Java Program

1️⃣ **Compile:**
```bash
javac ProgramName.java
```

2️⃣ **Run:**
```bash
java ProgramName
```

### Quick Example with BuffReader:
```bash
# Compile
javac BuffReader.java

# Run
java BuffReader

# Input & Output
Hello, Java!          ← You type this
Hello, Java!          ← Program echoes back
```
